# Flutter Responsive

Two app UIs built with Flutter to practice responsive design with the framework.

Both of them can be found at the following links:
- project 1: [Udemy clone](https://flutter-responsive-udemy-clone.vercel.app/)
- project 2: [Instagram clone](https://flutter-responsive-instagram-clone.vercel.app/)

In order to check how the screen behaves on different device size, you can inspect (_Ctrl + Shift + I_) and
select the screen sizes.

### Aknowledments

- [Web Renderers](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/web-renderers)
- To deploy on Vercel, it was removed from the `.gitignore` the build folder
